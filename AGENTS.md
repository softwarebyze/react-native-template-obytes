## PR evidence (always)

When the user asks for a fix/feature and you open or update a PR, **finish the chat reply** with this block (fill real numbers/links):

```text
Updated PR #<n>, preview <preview-url>.
PR includes screenshots and recordings showing the fix/feature.
```

When you mention a PR mid-reply (not only in that closer), include the preview URL next to it when one exists — e.g. [PR #129](…) · [preview](…). Not required on every casual mention; do it when the user asked about that work or when the preview is useful.
In the **PR body**, document each change with evidence — not a wall of text:

- `Fixed <thing>` + screenshot (or image link)
- `Fixed <thing>` + screen recording / video link
- Same pattern for features: `Added <thing>` + media

Prefer attaching evidence under `docs/pr-evidence/` (or the PR’s Files changed) and linking raw GitHub URLs so the PR renders media inline. Use Argent / simulator / web screenshots and short recordings when the change is visual.

Tracked as [#128](#128).

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Store listing updates

Prefer **`store.config.json` + `pnpm metadata:push` / `pnpm metadata:push:production`** (or Actions → **EAS Metadata Push**) over one-off App Store Connect API scripts. How-to: [docs/eas-metadata.md](./docs/eas-metadata.md). Screenshots: Fastlane — [docs/store-screenshots.md](./docs/store-screenshots.md) (`pnpm screenshots:upload:ios`). Price and privacy nutrition labels are ASC UI-only for now.

### Overview

Obytes-based Expo app. Keep demo auth/feed until the product replaces them.

### Running the app

- **Web (primary for Cloud Agents):** `pnpm web` — starts Expo web on port 8081.
- **Native (requires simulator/emulator):** `pnpm ios` / `pnpm android` — not available in Cloud Agent VMs.

### Lint / Type-check / Test

Standard commands from `package.json`:

```
pnpm lint          # ESLint (src, app.config.ts, env.ts, .maestro)
pnpm type-check    # tsc --noemit
pnpm test          # Jest unit tests
pnpm knip          # unused exports (also CI)
pnpm check-all     # lint + type-check + lint:translations + test + knip
```

### Environment setup notes

- `.env` is required — copy from `.env.example` (only sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development`).
- pnpm 10 may warn about ignored build scripts (`@parcel/watcher`, `esbuild`, `sharp`, `unrs-resolver`). These do **not** block lint, type-check, test, or web bundling — the pure-JS fallbacks work fine.
- No Docker, no external services, no API keys needed for local development.

### Pre-commit hooks (Husky)

The repo uses Husky with:

- `pre-commit`: runs `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint-staged`
- `commit-msg`: runs commitlint (conventional commits required)
- Branch protection: direct commits to `main`/`master` are blocked unless `SKIP_BRANCH_PROTECTION` is set.

Cloud Agents work on feature branches, so branch protection does not apply. Set `SKIP_BRANCH_PROTECTION=1` if needed.
